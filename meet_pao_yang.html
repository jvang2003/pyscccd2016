            <p>PaoYang has worked in post-secondary education sector for the last seventeen years. His work in education encompasses assisting students in obtaining their educational dream for a better future and equity. He has vast experience and knowledge of the academic challenges, accessibility barriers and inequities our community faces and the issues specific to District 2.<br><br>
            Pao has a Bachelor’s of Science degree in Electronic Engineering Technology from DeVry University and a Master’s of Science in Business Administration from Keller Graduate School of Management. He worked as a Product Development Engineer for Siliconix Inc., in Silicon Valley and found the tech industry to be rewarding. However, his passion was education, especially with helping students find direction and purpose in life. In line with his love for education, Paotaught business courses at ITT Technical Institute at their Clovis Campus. Subsequently heserved as the Director of Admissions for DeVry University at their Fresno and Bakersfield Campuses and then for Institute of Technology at their Clovis Campus.<br><br>
            Pao comes from a very patriotic family, and is proud of his family's involvement in the Secret War in Laos, which was the sill over of the Vietnam War.  With the fall of Saigon in 1975 and following the eventual withdrawal of all U.S. troops, his family had no choice but to leave their homes behind or risk persecution. They walked through the jungles of Laos and crossed the Mekong River to seek safe harbor within the refugee camps of Thailand. In 1979, at the age of six, Paoand his family came to the United States first settling in Wichita, Kansas. Desiring to be closer to family that had settled in the Central Valley, his family relocated to Fresno, California in 1983.<br><br>
            Like most immigrant families, Pao’s parents spoke very little English which made early schooling a challenge for him and his siblings. He worked very hard and persevered through those challenges. While attending Tehipite Middle School, he learned the importance of commitment, discipline, integrity, leadership and vision through the guidance of Major Michael Davis and his wife Valerie Davis (current Fresno Unified School Board member) of the California Cadet Corps, a youth program of the California National Guard. These principles have become his core values. Pao continues his family’s tradition of community involvement and currently serves as the Board Vice-President for Fresno Center for New Americans and is a Board of Advisor for the Asian Business and Institute Resource Center.<br><br>
            Pao looks forward to doing his utmost to protect the best interest of his constituents if he is fortunate enough to earn your trust and support as a member of the State Center Community College District Board of Trustee for District 2.
